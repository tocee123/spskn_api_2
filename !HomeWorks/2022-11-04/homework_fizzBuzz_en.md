# Exercise

Given a positive integer `n`, read from the keyboard, the upper border of the range (including). Going through the range you have to write to the terminal:

-   `"FizzBuzz"`  if  `i`  is divisible by  `3`  and  `5`.
-   `"Fizz"`  if  `i`  is divisible by  `3`.
-   `"Buzz"`  if  `i`  is divisible by  `5`.
-   `i`  if none of the above conditions are true.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** "1","2","Fizz"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** "1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 15
**Output:** "1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 104`
