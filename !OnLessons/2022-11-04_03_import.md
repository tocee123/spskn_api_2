# Importing
In `Python` you can add more functionality with attach/import different files/modules, whose functions/classes you can use. 
```py
import random
```
This imports the whole module of  `random` to work with random number. The usage of an external module is as following. Let's write 50 random numbers between 10 and 20.
_Note you have to use the `.` anotation_ `[module].[method/class]`
_Note you can put the import in any place, but place it **on the top of the file**_
```py
import random
for i in range(1,50):
	print(random.randint(10,20))
```
## From [module] import 
when you want to use only one method/class from the imported module use `from [module] import [function/class]`. In this case you don't have to use the `.`
```py
from  random  import  randint
for  i  in  range(100):
	print(randint(20,40), end=" ")
```
## As
You can rename the imported class/method with `as` keyword
```py
from  random  import  randint  as  rn
for  i  in  range(100):
	print(rn(20,40), end=" ")
```
